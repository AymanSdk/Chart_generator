## Introduction

The Chart Generator is a web-based tool that leverages the Chart.js library to provide users with a convenient way to visualize data. The project includes an HTML file (`index.html`), a JavaScript file (`script.js`), and a stylesheet (`style.css`). Users can choose different chart types, add data points dynamically, and change the chart type on the fly.
